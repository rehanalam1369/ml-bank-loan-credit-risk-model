Bank loan credit risk model 
# 🏦 ML Bank Loan Credit Risk Model

A machine learning project to predict the credit risk of bank loan applicants. This model helps banks assess whether a loan applicant is likely to default or repay the loan.
🚀 Demo

Check out the app here: Streamlit App Link

## 🚀 Features

- Binary classification (Loan Default: Yes/No)
- Data preprocessing pipeline
- Model training and evaluation
- Streamlit web app for interactive prediction
- Well-structured modular code
- Joblib model serialization

## 🧠 Model Description

The project uses a classification model (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) trained on customer demographic and financial information to predict loan repayment risk.

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
 https://github.com/rehanalam1369/ml-bank-loan-credit-risk-model.git
cd ml-bank-loan-credit-risk-model
🧪 Example Usage
